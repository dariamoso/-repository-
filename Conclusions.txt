These 2 tasks were quite simple and easy to understand.
I remember doing tasks with lists during my previous Python course and to be honest it was very difficult cause we weren't given enough explanation:( 
But Aleksei Vitalevich explains everything very clearly (especially the moment with the indexes/numeration). 
What else to conclude hmm. 
Also I tried a more advanced version of manual sorting, just slightly different.
